What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a git repository, it creates a .git directory in the PWD. This enables you to start saving git repositories within the git system.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The Staging area is the area in between the Repository and the working directory. You can do a "soft" save into the staging area, then actually commit the save into the repository.
